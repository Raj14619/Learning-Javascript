    //PART 1 DECLARING VARIABLES
/*
    let js = "amazing"; // DECLARING A VARIABLE CALLED 'js' AS STRING
    console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10); //OUTPUTTING CALCULATIONS TO CONSOLE

    console.log("Jonas"); //OUTPUTTING TO CONSOLE
    console.log(23); //OUTPUTTING TO CONSOLE

    let firstName ="Jonas";
    console.log(firstName);

    let age = 23;// THIS IS STORED USING THE NUMBER DATA TYPE IN JS (WHICH STORES INTEGERS AND FLOATS)
    let firstName = "Raj" // THIS IS THE STRING DATA TYPE IN JS
    let checkbox = true // THIS IS THE BOOLEAN DATA TYPE IN JS
    let undefinedVariable; // A variable which is declared and has an 'empty value'
    let ok = null; // Null
*/

//PART 2 - USING TYPEOF TO FIGURE OUT DATA TYPE OF VARIABLES

/*
    console.log(typeof 23); // Number
    console.log(typeof "Raj"); // String

    let javscriptIsFun = true; //javascriptIsFun is a boolean
    console.log(typeof javascriptIsFun); // javascriptIsFun is a boolean
    javscriptIsFun = "YES!"; // javascriptIsFun is now a string
    console.log(typeof javascriptIsFun) // this will now output string

    let year;
    console.log(year); // will be undefined because no data type and no value has been given
    console.log(typeof year); // will be undefined because no data type and no value has been given
    year = 1991;
    console.log(typeof year) //will now be number

    console.log(typeof null) //this is an error in javascript with using typeof on null, which returns an "object" although it shoudld actually be "null". This bug has not been fixed in javascript for legacy reasons.

*/

//PART 3 - Using Final in java

/*
const birthYear = 1991; // Const variable which is basically a final variblae in java (It cannot change it's value)

var job = "programmer"; // VAR IS SOMETHING IN LEGACY CODE OF JAVSCRIPT, AVOID USING IT. IT IS USED TO DECLARE VARIABLES
job = "teacher"; // VAR IS SOMETHING IN LEGACY CODE OF JAVSCRIPT, AVOID USING IT. IT IS USED TO DECLARE VARIABLES

lastName = "Schmdetmann" // This is another way to declare a variable, but is bad way of doing so, Always use "let before declaring."
